# ioChem-BD documentation

The ioChem-BD platform [www.iochem-bd.org](http://www.iochem-bd.org) is a multi-headed tool aimed at managing large volumes of quantum chemistry results from a diverse group of already common simulation packages.

A heavy use of the Chemical Mark-up Language \(CML\) is made in the intermediate files used by ioChem-BD. From them and using XSL techniques, we manipulate and transform such chemical data sets to fulfill researchersâ€™ needs in the form of HTML5 reports, supporting information, and other research media.  
Please consider reading the [Basic introduction to ioChem-BD software](/platform-introduction.md) before continuing reading this wiki. Here you will view the features and data flows that this software contains in order to manage quantum chemistry calculations.
