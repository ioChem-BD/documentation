These are the recommended system requirements to run ioChem-BD software

## Hardware requirements

* A multicore CPU \(1 GHz or better\) is advised to allow multiuser interaction without bottlenecks or delays in calculation data extraction and manipulation.
* 4 Gb RAM \(8 Gb recommended\)
* At least +20 Gb of free disk space \(ioChem-BD installation takes 1.2Gb of disk space, so the remaining Gb are reserved for storing uploaded calculations\).

## Software requirements

* Linux OS 2.6.24 or greater \(64 bit\)\(Tested on Centos/Fedora/Debian\)
* PostgreSQL 9.1+ database server
* gcc package, used to compile INCHI libraries \( _yum install gcc_ / _apt-get install gcc_\),

The ioChem-BD software is a java web service that already bundles its own java run-time version, so there are no major requirements than the ones described previously.
