##Uploading content
There are two ways to upload content to the Create module.

  * Via [web interface](#webupload), used anywhere with an Internet connection and a web browser
  * Via [shell client](#shellupload), used on command-line-only environments, like calculation clusters

Every upload model has its pros and cons, on every section we will analyze them.

###Web interface
**Pros**:

  * Faster content navigation via point and click and its contextual menus that can expand/collapse project child elements recursively,
  * Rich data visualization via JSmol application, and HTML5 reports
  * Displayed information adapts to any type of electronic device

**Cons**:

  * Its upload mechanism is slower when compared to a shell client, users must manually attach every file associated with a calculation.


Inside the Create module, data is stored using two structures: projects and calculations, which are generated by users.

###Shell client

**Pros**: 
  * All shell client commands are easily scriptable so you can achieve actions like: automated project generation, navigation, calculation upload and management, while easing the process of populating the Create module with new content.
  
**Cons**: 
  * Navigation among content is not as straightforward as on the web interface.
